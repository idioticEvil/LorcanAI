# LorcanAI
LorcanAI is an open-source project that aims to create an LLM-powered system that can understand and play the trading card game Lorcana, created by The Walt Disney Company and Ravensburger. This is a personal project started by Walter Mink.
## How it works
LorcanAI is a work-in-progress, and I just started my development of it. My plan is to use Beautiful Soup & Selenium in Python to scrape a website to create a fully featured MongoDB database of all of the game's cards, along with their attributes and abilities. Then, I plan to build out a system to monitor / keep track of game state. Then, I plan on integrating an API for a large language model (LLM), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, or Anthropic's Claude, using chain-of-thought prompting to allow the LLM to "think through" making decisions in the game. With these elements combined, hopefully I will have created a system that can understand the mechanics of a trading card game and can play against a user. This plan may change as I develop this project.
## Installation
Currently, the LorcanAI project is not in a state where a user can install and use it. This section will be updated when that point has been reached.
## Attributions
This section will contain necessary attributions for 3rd party software & libraries used in the creation of this project. Currently, the project makes use of Beautiful Soup, Selenium, & LXML.
